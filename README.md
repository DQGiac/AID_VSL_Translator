<h1>IDEA</h1>
With a population of over one million <sup><a href="https://www.dvv-international.de/en/adult-education-and-development/editions/aed-842017-inclusion-and-diversity/columns/raising-the-voice-of-deaf-people">[*]</a></sup>, the deaf community in Vietnam is growing larger and larger every day. In every day life, they face numerous difficulties that could even harm their health (cannot communicate with doctors, nurses...). There are sign languages in Vietnam, but between regions are vast differences and the number of learners/teachers are currently extremely low. Not to mention, not everybody knows sign language, so it is extremely difficult to communicate with everyone. And that is why we coded a sign language translator.<br>
<br>
<h1>FEATURES</h1>
<b>Sign language to voice</b>:
<li>Trained model to recognize individual letters in the alphabet and a few common words with Keras's Image recognition</li>
<li>Used gTTS (Google's Text to Speech)</li>
<br>
<b>Voice to sign language</b>:
<li>Used SpeechRecognition</li>
<li>From text, display image from (hand-selected) dictionary.</li>
<br>
<b>Compatible with</b>:
<li>Zoom calls</li>
<li>Google Meet</li>
<h1>VISION</h1>
Develop the project into an API but easy-to-use, code-free, and user-friendly.<br>
Essentially envisioned to be a drag-and-drop style app for the deaf to create whatever creation to suit their personal needs (shopping, medical checkups, educational purposes, etc.)
