<h1>IDEA</h1>
With a population of over one million <sup><a href="https://www.dvv-international.de/en/adult-education-and-development/editions/aed-842017-inclusion-and-diversity/columns/raising-the-voice-of-deaf-people">[1]</a></sup>, the deaf community in Vietnam is growing every day. They face numerous difficulties in everyday life that could potentially harm them (unable to communicate with doctors and nurses or create social isolation, contributing to stress and depression).<br>
Sign languages do exist in Vietnam, but only to a small extent, due to differences in signs between regions (there are at least 3 different sign languages <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_sign_languages">[2]</a></sup>) and the extremely low number of both learners and teachers. Not to mention, not everybody knows sign language, so it is extremely difficult to communicate with other people.<br>
We chose to develop a sign language translator directed towards Vietnamese using Hanoi Sign Language as the core.<br>
<br>
<h1>FEATURES</h1>
<b>Sign language to voice</b>:
<li>Trained model to recognize individual letters in the alphabet and a few common words with Keras's Image recognition</li>
<li>Used gTTS (Google's Text to Speech)</li>
<br>
<b>Voice to sign language</b>:
<li>Used SpeechRecognition</li>
<li>From text, display image from (hand-selected) dictionary.</li>
<br>
<b>Compatible with</b>:
<li>Zoom calls</li>
<li>Google Meet</li>
<br>
<h1>VISION</h1>
Develop the project into an API but easy-to-use, code-free, and user-friendly.<br>
A drag-and-drop style app for the deaf to create whatever creation to suit their personal needs (shopping, medical checkups, educational purposes, etc.)
