<h1>Idea</h1>
With a population of over one million <sub><a href="https://www.dvv-international.de/en/adult-education-and-development/editions/aed-842017-inclusion-and-diversity/columns/raising-the-voice-of-deaf-people">[*]</a></sub>, the deaf community in Vietnam is growing larger and larger every day. In every day life, they face numerous difficulties that could even harm their health (cannot communicate with doctors, nurses...). There are sign languages in Vietnam, but it has regional dialects and the number of learners/teachers are currently extremely low. Not to mention, not everybody knows sign language, so it is extremely difficult to communicate with everyone. And that is why we coded a sign language translator.<br>

<h1>Features</h1>
Sign language to voice:
- Trained model to recognize the alphabet and a few common words and output text
- From text we change it into voice using gTTS (Google's Text-to-speech)
